# Getting Started with Create React App

* In an introductory course on how to utilize HTML and CSS, we focused on learning JavaScript, specifically using the React library.
* Inside the folder "src", you can see the two main files, App.js and index.js, along with two folders named "Components" and "Styles".
* Index.js is the entry file where I render the DOM, while App.js outlines the structure of the app. The latter imports all React components from the "Components" folder, where each contains its respective JS file.
* The backend was done using Google Firebase.
* The applicaiton mimics an e-commerce site focused on apparel.
